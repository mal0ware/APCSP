Doctors 50 years ago were pretty similar to today.
Today's doctors simply have access to a multitude of technologies that have improved their work.
People in 20 years may still have doctors, however much less as I assume that AI will be quickly making its breakthroughs and have computers diagnose patients.
Computer programs already have a large role in many jobs today, however in the medical field specifically, the computers may either help doctors or replace them completely.
