1. Python was used and the program was a 4 panel story board

2.first we planned out what was going to happen on each panel. 
then we made some more specific steps as to how we were going to accomplish that.
finally, we put it into work changing things as we went along for the specific details.

3. the output of our program is what was expected, a 4 panel story about a man named keith that lost his dog and found it again.

4. One student created function was the text1() function, which was for the initial text on the first panel.
This used sequencing when it gets called, being before line 2 and after the background is added.

5. So text1() function is created as the very first line of text in the story, being on the first panel and the first one being added.
this is accomplished by def text1(): and openingLine = Text("On a bright sunny day,") being the value within it. Other changes are made to the font size and color.
Then the function is called in the scene before the 2nd line and after the background is printed.
