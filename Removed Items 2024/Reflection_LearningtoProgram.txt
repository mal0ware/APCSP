i think i should learn to program because due to Moore's law, computers will quickly surpass the power of the human brain. It is clear computers are the future.

Computer Programming can be used as a tool to pretty much shape any idea I have into a computer,
and utilize the computers power to make peoples lives easier and stuff like that. 
Computers have a lot of potential
