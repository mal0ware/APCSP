so first your computer has a link, or a URL. This URL contains HTTP which is the distribution protocol for the internet, as well as the subfolders. So this URL will get send to the DNS server to return a usable IP address from the given URL. It will start from the Root server, and then go to the .com subfolder where codehs will be stored. Then it will continue going through the subfolders until it gets to the png file. Your computer will request a copy of the PNG file, and when it is recieved, it will download onto your computer.
